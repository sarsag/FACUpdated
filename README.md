# FACUpdated

An updated version of my submission of the FAC Application website, fixing some bugs and some quirks.

A list of all changes from the original website:

1) Head tag repositioned outside the body tag (not sure how that happened!)
2) Scroll behaviour smooth added to give a nicer transition when clicking on the navigation links.
3) Added a favicon for a more polished look.
4) Removed preventDefault() as it was not fulfilling the intended purpose.
5) Fixed slider dots, these unfortunately stopped working when I decoupled the HTML, CSS and JS files.
6) Changed default HTML pic for the slider, to better reflect its order.
7) Changed slider code to remove modulus that was attached to the functionality of the dots, now alot cleaner and easier to understand, and also allows us to more add pictures in the future. 
8) Generally neatened up code to allow for better readability.

Thank you :)
